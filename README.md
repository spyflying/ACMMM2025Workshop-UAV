## Abstract
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, have become increasingly popular in recent years due to their ability to capture high-quality multimedia data from the sky. With the rise of multimedia applications, such as aerial photography, cinematography, and mapping, UAVs have emerged as a powerful tool for gathering rich and diverse multimedia content. This workshop aims to bring together researchers, practitioners, and enthusiasts interested in UAV multimedia to explore the latest advancements, challenges, and opportunities in this exciting field. The workshop will cover various topics related to UAV multimedia, including aerial image and video processing, machine learning for UAV data analysis, UAV swarm technology, and UAV-based multimedia applications. In the context of the ACM Multimedia conference, this workshop is highly relevant as multimedia data from UAVs is becoming an increasingly important source of content for many multimedia applications. The workshop will provide a platform for researchers to share their work and discuss potential collaborations, as well as an opportunity for practitioners to learn about the latest developments in UAV multimedia technology. Overall, this workshop will provide a unique opportunity to explore the exciting and rapidly evolving field of UAV multimedia and its potential impact on the wider multimedia community.


**The list of possible topics includes, but is not limited to:**

*  Video-based UAV Navigation
    + Satellite-guided & Ground-guided Navigation
    + Path Planning and Obstacle Avoidance
    + Visual SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)
    + Sensor Fusion and Reinforcement Learning for Navigation
* UAV Swarm Coordination
    + Multiple Platform Collaboration
    + Multi-agent Cooperation and Communication
    + Decentralized Control and Optimization
    + Distributed Perception and Mapping

    + 3D Mapping and Reconstruction
    + Remote Sensing and Image Analysis
    + Disaster Response and Relief
* UAV-based Delivery and Transportation
    + Package Delivery and Logistics
    + Safety and Regulations for UAV-based Transportation


## Submission Types

Paper can be submitted on [[Open Review]](https://openreview.net/group?id=acmmm.org/ACMMM/2025/Workshop/UAVM).

Submission template can be found at [ACM](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template) or you may directly follow the [overleaf template](https://www.overleaf.com/read/yfpxtyngmzjn).

**We recommend the single-blind (showing your name and affilliation) for fast processing, but double-blind papers are also acceptable. We will ensure the fairness.**

In this workshop, we welcome four types of submissions, all of which should relate to the topics and themes as listed in Section 3: 

- (1). Challenge papers (**up to 4 pages in length, plus unlimited pages for references**): original solution to the Challenge data, University160k, in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. 

- (2). Original papers (**up to 4 pages in length, plus unlimited pages for references**): original ideas, perspectives, research vision, and open challenges in the area of evaluation approaches for UAVs in Multimedia; Page limits include diagrams and appendices.

Page limits include diagrams and appendices. Submissions should be single-blind, written in English, and formatted according to the current ACM two-column conference format. Suitable LaTeX, Word, and Overleaf templates are available from the ACM Website (use “sigconf” proceedings template for LaTeX and the Interim Template for Word).

**Tips:**
- For privacy protection, please blur faces in the published materials (such as paper, video, poster, etc.) 
- For social good, please do not contain any misleading words, such as ``surveillance`` and  ``secret``.


## Challenge

**Challenge Platform is at https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/18770 .**

This year’s focus is specifically on matching partial street images to corresponding satellite images (illustrated in Figure 3). By concentrating on partial views, our aim is to more accurately reflect real-world scenarios where obstructions or limited sensor angles may restrict the field of view, such as during low-altitude UAV operations for navigation, search-and-rescue missions, and autonomous flight. We harness University-1652 [40] as the challenge dataset, which provides 2,579 street images as query and 951 gallery satellite images. To encourage broader participation and innovation, we will make University-1652 training set available through our website with name-masked test set, along with a public leaderboard. 

Check challenge details at Section 5 in [https://zdzheng.xyz/files/MM24_Workshop_Proposal_Drone.pdf](https://zdzheng.xyz/files/MM24_Workshop_Proposal_Drone.pdf)

The challenge dataset contains two part.
1. The basic dataset (training set) can be download by [Request](https://github.com/layumi/University1652-Baseline/blob/master/Request.md). Usually I will reply the download link in 5 minutes. 

2. The name-masked test-160k-WX dataset (query & gallery+distractor) can be downloaded from [Onedrive](https://hdueducn-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/wongtyu_hdu_edu_cn/EoP7u9rymIxMrv_s3Im-vvQBX8PQ_4v1xzXolMfyKmINkw?e=N8vpum).
Since only drone will meet weather conditions, we only simulate weather on drone-view queries. 

The submission example can be found at [Baseline Submission](https://github.com/wtyhub/ACMMM2024Workshop/blob/main/answer.txt). Please zip it as `answer.zip` to submit the result.

Please return the top-10 satellite names. For example, the first query is `Q3JI2tUwDkhcfip.jpeg`. Therefore, the first line of returned result in `answer.txt` should be the format as follows:
```
e6kXgz36E8nOY2n       ioqKwvSIYYhiW2v       y4VmQPUYOMD8AH4       kpZ2QJlNBHMnbRA       xffJQs2n9DP17fg       IejrFHLQYBfce2y       cH79t5WJMEMZ3VA       W9u0j4N1nlFbI97       zDurtAW4FTJfNJ3       MuvIMNVdofmaRqG
```
Please return the result following the order of query at [Query TXT](https://github.com/wtyhub/ACMMM2024Workshop/blob/main/query_drone_name.txt)
It will be 37855 lines.
